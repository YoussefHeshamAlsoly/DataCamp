    "All right, let's continue on. You now know how to use the merge method to perform an inner and left join. The merge method supports two other join types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Right join**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the right join. It will return all of the rows from the right table and includes only those rows from the left table that have matching values. It is the mirror opposite of the left join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Right join**\n",
    "\n",
    "These example tables show the result of a right join. Only rows from the left table where the column C matches are returned. Where there isn't a match, the columns from the left table will be missing in the result table, like rows one and four.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Looking at data**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, let's look at another table called movie_to_genres. Movies can have multiple genres, and this table lists different genres for each movie.\n",

    "**5. Filtering the data**\n",

    "**6. Data to merge**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goa...e the key column used to join the tables has no match, null values are returned. That is why in the result, the columns from the left table are missing in rows one and five, and in column D row three is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Datasets for outer join**\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example of this, we filter the movie_to_genres table as before into two very small tables. One table has data on Family movies, and the other has Comedy movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Merge with outer join**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this merge, we list the family table as the left table and merge it on the movie_id column. The how argument is set to outer for an outer join. Both of our tables have the same column names. Therefore, we add suffixes to show what table the columns originated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our result table, every row is returned for both tables and we see some null values. In our original comedy tables ID number 12 does not exist. Therefore a null is shown. Similarly, in our last row, movie ID 13 wasn't in the family dataset so it has a null.\n",

    "Outer Join: You learned that an outer join returns all rows from both tables, filling in with nulls where there is no match. This join type is particularly useful for finding unmatched data between two tables.\n",

    "Merging with Different Column Names: You explored how to merge tables when the key columns have different names using the `left_on` and `right_on` parameters in the `merge` method.\n",
