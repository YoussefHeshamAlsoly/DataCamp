    "**1. Inner join**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! I am Aaren Stubberfield and I will be your instructor for this course. The pandas package is a powerful tool for manipulating and transforming data in Python. However, when working on an analysis, the data needed could be in multiple tables. This course will focus on the vital skill of merging tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. For clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we start, two quick clarifications. First, through other courses on DataCamp, you may have learned how to import tabular data as DataFrames. In this course, you may hear the words table and DataFrame, but they are equivalent here. Second, we will refer to combining different tables together as merging tables, but note that some refer to this same process as joining.\n",

    "**3. Chicago data portal dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us learn about merging tables, we will use data from the city of Chicago data portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Datasets for example**\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Chicago is divided into fifty local neighborhoods called wards. We have a table with data about the local government offices in each ward. In this example, we want to merge the local government data with census data about the population of each ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The ward data**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the wards table, we have information about the local government of each ward, such as the government office address. This table has 50 rows and 4 columns, or one row for each ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Census data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The census table contains the population of each ward in 2000 and 2010, and that change as a percentage. Additionally, it includes the address for the center of each ward. This table has 50 rows and 6 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Merging tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two tables are related by their ward column. We can merge them together, matching the ward number from each row of the wards table to the ward numbers from the census table. For example, the second ward in the wards table with Alderman Brian Hopkins would be matched with row 2 of the census table where the population in 2000 was 54,361.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Inner join**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas package has an excellent DataFrame method for performing this type of merge called merge. The merge method takes the first DataFrame, wards, and merges it with the second DataFrame, census. We use the on argument to tell the method that we want to merge the two DataFrames on the ward column. Since we listed the wards table first, its columns will appear first in the output, followed by the columns from the census table. In this example, the merge returns a DataFrame with 50 rows and 9 columns, where the returned rows have matching values for the ward column in both tables. This is called an inner join.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Inner join**\n",
    "\n",
    "An inner join will only return rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Suffixes**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the merged table has columns with suffixes of underscore x or y. This is because both the wards and census tables contained address and zip columns. To avoid multiple columns with the same name, they are automatically given a suffix by the merge method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Suffixes**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the suffix argument of the merge method to control this behavior. We provide a tuple where all of the overlapping columns in the left table are given the suffix '_ward', and those of the right table will be given the suffix '_cen'. This makes it easier for us to tell the difference between the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Let's practice!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's practice using the merge method.\n"

    "\n",
    "Your recent learnings\n",
    "When you left 2 days ago, you worked on Data Merging Basics, chapter 1 of the course Joining Data with pandas. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about the fundamentals of merging tables in pandas, focusing on inner joins. Inner joins are a method to combine rows from two tables based on a common column, returning only rows with matching values in both tables. Here are the key points you covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understanding DataFrames and Tables: You discovered that in pandas, tables are represented as DataFrames, and merging them is a crucial skill for data analysis.\n",
    "- The `merge()` Method: You learned how to use pandas' `merge()` method to join two DataFrames. For example, to merge two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, on a common column named '`common_column`', you would use `df1.merge(df2, on='common_column')`.\n",
    "Inner Join Mechanics: An inner join returns a DataFrame containing only the rows that have matching values in both tables. This was illustrated through merging ward and census data, where only wards present in both DataFrames were included in the result.\n",
    "Suffixes in Merged DataFrames: You saw how pandas handles overlapping column names by appending suffixes, and you learned to customize these suffixes using the `suffixes` argument in the `merge()` method to make the output clearer.\n",
    "Practical Application: Through exercises, you applied these concepts by merging Chicago taxi owners and vehicle tables on the '`vid`' column to analyze taxi fuel types, demonstrating the real-world utility of inner joins.\n",
    "This lesson equipped you with the knowledge to merge data from multiple sources, a vital skill for uncovering insights in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the next lesson is to teach how to effectively combine and analyze data from multiple sources using one-to-many relationships, enhancing your ability to conduct comprehensive data analysis."
