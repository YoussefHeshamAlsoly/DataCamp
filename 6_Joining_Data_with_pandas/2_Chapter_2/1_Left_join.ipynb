    "**1. Left join**\n",
    "Greetings, and welcome back! In this lesson, we will discuss how a left join works, which is another way to merge two tables. Before we start talking about left joins, let's quickly review what we have learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Quick review**\n",
    "In chapter 1, we introduced the pandas merge method that allows us to combine two tables by specifying one or more key columns to link the tables by. By default, the merge method performs an inner join, returning only the rows of data with matching values in the key columns of both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Left join**\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll talk about the idea of a left join. A left join returns all rows of data from the left table and only those rows from the right table where key columns match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Left join**\n",
    "Here we have two tables named left and right. We want to use a left join to merge them on key column C. A left join returns all of the rows from the left table and only those rows from the right table where column C matches in both. Notice the second ...in both tables. However, notice an additional argument named 'how'. This argument defines how to merge the two tables. In this case, we use 'left' for a left join. The default value for how is 'inner', so we didn't need to specify this in Chapter 1 since we were only working with inner joins. The result of the merge shows a table with all of the rows from the movies table and a value for tag line where the ID column matches in both tables. Wherever there isn't a matching ID in the taglines table, a null value is entered for the tag line. Remember that pandas uses NaN to denote missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Number of rows returned**\n",
    "After the merge, our resulting table has 4,805 rows. This is because we are returning all of the rows of data from the movies table, and the relationship between the movies table and taglines is one-to-one. Therefore, in a one-to-one merge like this one, a left join will always return the same number rows as the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Let's practice!**\n",
    "Now, let's practice some."

When performing a left join, the .merge() method returns a row full of null values for columns in the right table if the key column does not have a matching value in both tables. We see that there are at least 1,500 rows missing data. Wow! That sounds like a lot of work.\n",
