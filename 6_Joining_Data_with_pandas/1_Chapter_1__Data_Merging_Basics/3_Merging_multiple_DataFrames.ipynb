    "**1. Merging multiple DataFrames**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back. In our last lesson, we learned how to merge two tables with a one-to-many relationship using the merge method. Merging data like this is a necessary skill to bring together data from different sources to answer some more complex data questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Merging multiple tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need to merge together more than just two tables to complete our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Remembering the licenses table**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we used two tables from the city of Chicago. One table contained business licenses issued by the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Remembering the wards table**\n",
    "\n",
    "The other table listed info about the local neighborhoods called wards, including the local government official's office.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Review new data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we also have a table of businesses that have received small business grant money from Chicago. The grants are funded by taxpayer money. Therefore, it would be helpful to analyze how much grant money each business received and in what ward that business...ing multiple tables\n",
    "We can now extend this example to a third table. First, we merge the grants table with the wards table on the ward column again, adding suffixes to the repeated column names. Note that we're using Python's backslash line continuation method to add the second merge on the next line. Python will read this as just one line of code. Without this, Python will throw a syntax error since it will parse it as two separate lines of code, so don't forget your backslash. Now our output table has information about grants, business, and wards. We can now complete our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now sum the grants by ward and plot the results. Some wards have received more grants than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Merging even more...**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could continue to merge additional tables as needed. We stopped at three, but if needed, we could continue to add more. The code here shows the pattern you would follow as you merge more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Let's practice!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's practice merging multiple tables."

    "### Description:\n",
    "Your goal is to find the total number of rides provided to passengers passing through the Wilson station (`station_name == 'Wilson'`) when riding Chicago's public transportation system on weekdays (`day_type == 'Weekday'`) in July (`month == 7`). Luckily, Chicago provides this detailed data, but it is in three different tables. You will work on merging these tables together to answer the question. This data is different from the business related data you have seen so far, but all the information you need to answer the question is provided.\n",

    "The cal, ridership, and stations DataFrames have been loaded for you. The relationship between the tables can be seen in the diagram below.\n",

    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instruction 1:\n",
    "Merge the ridership and cal tables together, starting with the ridership table on the left and save the result to the variable ridership_cal. If you code takes too long to run, your merge conditions might be incorrect.\n",

    "Extend the previous merge to three tables by also merging the stations table.\n",

    "\n",
    "___\n",

    "Create a variable called `filter_criteria` to select the appropriate rows from the merged table so that you can sum the `rides` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code:\n",

    "Three table merge\n",
    "To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are.

However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The `land_use` table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The `census` table has population by ward, and the `licenses` table lists businesses by ward.\n",

    "The concept of merging tables with a one-to-many relationship using the merge method, which is essential for bringing together disparate data sources.\n",
    "The importance of selecting the correct keys (columns) for merging tables to avoid duplicating or losing data. For example, merging on both address and zip code to ensure accurate matching of records.\n",
    "How to merge more than two tables by chaining the merge method, and the significance of adding suffixes to differentiate columns with the same name from different tables.\n",
    "The practical application of these techniques through exercises, including merging business licenses, grants, and ward information to analyze grant distribution across wards.\n",
