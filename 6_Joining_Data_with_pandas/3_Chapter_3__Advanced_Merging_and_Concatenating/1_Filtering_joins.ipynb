    "**1. Filtering joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third chapter! In this lesson, we will discuss a type of join called a filtering join. pandas doesn't provide direct support for filtering joins, but we will learn how to replicate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mutating versus filtering joins**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have only worked with mutating joins, which combines data from two tables. However, filtering joins filter observations from one table based on whether or not they match an observation in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is a semi join?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a semi join. A semi join filters the left table down to those observations that have a match in the right table. It is similar to an inner join where only the intersection between the tables is returned, but unlike an inner join, only the columns from the left table are shown. Finally, no duplicate rows from the left table are returned, even if there is a one-to-many relationship. Let's look at an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Musical dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter, the dataset we will use is from an onl...example. Instead of finding which genres are in the table of top tracks, let's now find which genres are not with an anti join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Example datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this new dataset, we have a table of song genres shown here. There's also a table of top-rated song tracks. The 'gid' column connects the two tables. Let's say we want to find what genres appear in our table of top songs. A semi join would return only the columns from the genre table and not the tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Step 1 - semi join**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's merge the two tables with an inner join. We also print the first few rows of the genres_tracks variable. Since this is an inner join, the returned 'gid' column holds only values where both tables matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Step 2 - semi join**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step in the technique, let's focus on this line of code. It uses a method called isin(), which compares every 'gid' in the genres table to the 'gid' in the genres_tracks table. This will tell us if our genre appears in our merged genres_tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Step 2 - semi join**\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of code returns a Boolean Series of true or false values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Step 3 - semi join**\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine everything, we use that line of code to subset the genres table. The results are saved to top_genres and we print a few rows. We've completed a semi join. These are rows in the genre table that are also found in the top_tracks table. This is called a filtering join because we've filtered the genres table by what's in the top_tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. What is an anti join?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about anti joins. An anti join returns the observations in the left table that do not have a matching observation in the right table. It also only returns the columns from the left table. Now, let's go back to our example. Instead of finding which genres are in the table of top tracks, let's now find which genres are not with an anti join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Step 1 - anti join**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to use a left join returning all of the rows from the left table. Here we'll use the indicator argument and set it to True. With indicator set to True, the merge method adds a column called \"_merge\" to the output. This column tells the source of each row. For example, the first four rows found a match in both tables, whereas the last can only be found in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Step 2 - anti join**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use the \"loc\" accessor and \"_merge\" column to select the rows that only appeared in the left table and return only the \"gid\" column from the genres_tracks table. We now have a list of gids not in the tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. Step 3 - anti join**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final step we use the isin() method to filter for the rows with gids in our gid_list. Our output shows those genres not in the tracks table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Let's practice!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your turn."

    "Steps of a semi join\n",
    "In the last video, you were shown how to perform a semi join with `pandas`. In this exercise, you'll solidify your understanding of the necessary steps. Recall that a semi join filters the left table to only the rows where a match exists in both the left and right tables.\n",

    "# Filtering joins Recap:\n",
    "You learned about advanced techniques for merging and concatenating DataFrames in pandas, focusing on filtering joins like semi-joins and anti-joins, and how to validate and combine data structures efficiently. Here are the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-joins: You discovered that a semi-join filters the left DataFrame to only those rows that have a matching value in the right DataFrame. Unlike an inner join, it returns just the columns from the left DataFrame without duplicates. For instance, to find genres present in a table of top songs, you first performed an inner join and then used the isin() method to filter the genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-joins: You learned that an anti-join returns rows from the left DataFrame that do not have a matching row in the right DataFrame, again only returning columns from the left DataFrame. This was demonstrated by finding genres not present in the top tracks table, using a left join with the indicator argument set to True, and then filtering with the _merge column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenating DataFrames: The lesson covered using pandas.concat to vertically combine DataFrames, which is crucial when you want to append rows from one DataFrame to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation: You learned techniques for validating your combined data structures to ensure accuracy and integrity in your data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a snippet of code you worked with, demonstrating how to perform a semi-join:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> # Merge the non_mus_tck and top_invoices tables on tid\n",
    "> tracks_invoices = non_mus_tcks.merge(top_invoices, on='tid')\n",
    "> \n",
    "> # Use .isin() to subset non_mus_tcks to rows with tid in tracks_invoices\n",
    "> top_tracks = non_mus_tcks[non_mus_tcks['tid'].isin(tracks_invoices['tid'])]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> # Group the top_tracks by gid and count the tid rows\n",
    "> cnt_by_gid = top_tracks.groupby(['gid'], as_index=False).agg({'tid':'count'})\n",
    "> \n",
    "> # Merge the genres table to cnt_by_gid on gid and print\n",
    "> print(cnt_by_gid.merge(genres, on='gid'))\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code exemplifies how to merge tables and filter them to get meaningful insights, such as identifying top revenue-generating non-musical tracks by genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the next lesson is to teach you how to merge and concatenate DataFrames in pandas, specifically focusing on vertical concatenation, to combine data from various sources for comprehensive analysis."
